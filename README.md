This is a basic patch/external/plugin/device built in Max/MSP for adjusting stereo settings. This is different from br.utility.stereo.1.0 as it allows for inverting of the channels, along with panning and gain.
  
**Invert_mode** Allows for inverting the signal of both, or either channel

**Left_Decibels** Adjust the gain of the left channel between -72.0 and +35 decibels. -72.0 instantly converts to negative infinity. 

**Right_Decibels** Adjust the gain of the right channel between -72.0 and +35 decibels. -72.0 instantly converts to negative infinity. 

**Left_Panning** Allows for the left channel coming in to be panned to either channel. Default is -100. (Left). Range is -100.0 to +100.0, with 0.0 being the middle.  

**Right_Panning** Allows for the right channel coming in to be panned to either channel. Default is 100. (Right) Range is -100.0 to +100.0, with 0.0 being the middle.
