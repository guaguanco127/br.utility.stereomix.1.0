## <a name="External"></a>What is an External for Max/MSP?

An external is a type of object that does not come with your Max/MSP library. Unlike the typical objects that you can call on all versions of Max/MSP, an external must be installed on the users computer a specific way. 

## <a name="VST"></a>What is a VST or AU Audio Plugin? 

A VST is a third party audio plugin generally run within a digital audio workstation (DAW). A VST is cross platform for both Windows and Macintosh. An AU works the same way but is exclusively for Macintosh.
